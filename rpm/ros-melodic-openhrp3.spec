%description
This package does not only wrap OpenHRP3 but actually provides the built
artifact from the code from its mainstream repository. Being ROS-agnostic by
itself, you can also use this via ROS together with the packages in
rtmros_common that bridge between two framework. OpenHRP3 (Open Architecture
Human-centered Robotics Platform version 3) is an integrated software platform
for robot simulations and software developments. It allows the users to inspect
an original robot model and control program by dynamics simulation. In addition,
OpenHRP3 provides various software components and calculation libraries that can
be used for robotics related software developments (excerpts from here). The
package version number is synchronized to that of mainstream, based on this
decision.
